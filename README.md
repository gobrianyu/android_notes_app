## Design Vision
Tell us about what your design vision was.
 - Functionally
 - Aesthetically
 - Data

I wanted to create a notes app, similar to the one I use on my phone: Samsung Notes.
I particularly wanted to recreate the two-column grid in that app. The app functionality
itself is quite simple. The only addition I made was an editable title field; which isn't
all too revolutionary.

Where in your repo can we find the design sketches that you made?
In the assets folder. The file name is sketch.jpg.

If your final design changed from your initial sketches please explain what changed and why.
I was really ambitious in my sketch, where I wanted to add more functionalities than I ended
up adding, such as a way to delete files, more buttons, perhaps some text formatting, and
colour themes. I was unable to realise these largely because of time limitations.

## Reflection Prompts

### New Learnings
What new tools, techniques, or other skills did you learn while doing this assignment?

How do you think you might use what you learned in the future?

Answer here: 
Once again, a lot of new classes and widgets. I also gained a better understanding of Providers.
I'm still a littler iffy but I think this has been great practice for the future.

## Challenges
What was hard about doing this assignment?
What did you learn from working through those challenges?
How could the assignment be improved for future years?

Answer here:
Oh my goodness I had so many stumbles. I think getting to talk to some other people while developing
was a big help.

### Mistakes
What is one mistake that you made or misunderstanding that you had while you were completing this assignment?

What is something that you learned or will change in the future as a result of this mistake or misunderstanding?

Answer here:
It was a silly mistake. I had a call for the original entry rather than the new entry when popping from navigator.
This was the source of a multiple-hour headache.

### Meta
How much time (in minutes or hours of active work) did you spend working on this assignment? What parts took the longest?
What could we do to make this assignment better in the future?

Far longer than I had anticipated. ~8 hours I would say. The longest part was me debugging my silly mistakes...
